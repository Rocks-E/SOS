# SOS
Shitty Operating System

## What is this?
The title pretty much says it all.

## Why is this?
I've wanted to work on some sort of small-scale OS since having a university class about it. Initially we were presented with "you will be building an OS in this class". What they *actually* meant was "you will fill in some values for an OS in this class, and we will provide videos telling you exactly what to do and how to do it". I've been a big fan of low-level programming for quite some time now, and it's been a while since I've had a project to commit to, so I figured why not start now?

## How is this?
I don't want to make this too ambitious right out the gate, so there are very limited plans here. I have a lot to learn but I can at least lay out some of my goals to work toward now.
1. The operating system should have some method for handling multiple processes at a time. I know this is basic, I know this is effectively what makes an operating system, but it feels worth mentioning.
2. Users and permissions. Also basic but I don't see why an OS *couldn't* support just one generic user. Honestly this one is pretty negotiable.
3. A basic shell. Don't expect it to be super advanced but something that can traverse the file system and execute commands. Speaking of-
4. A file system. Does this even need to be stated?
5. NO GUI. This isn't a feature, I guess, but I intentionally want no GUI - at least for this project. I really like working with a terminal and I don't want that messed up with graphics.
6. ???

It should be obvious that I'm still pretty new to this and will be figuring a lot of things out, but as long as I have some direction to work toward.

## Where is this?
I was thinking x86 would make the most sense but I'm kind of wondering now what it would be like to make an OS for the 6502 architecture. x86 would probably be easier to start with but 6502 sounds way more interesting. I'll stick with x86 for now.
Other than that, this is in the kitchen currently.
